WORK IN PROGRESS -- A site I started making for my sister in law's startup wedding decoration business. She ended up using wix because it was a simple site and she preferred having more control over it, and then I started copying that design too. All good practice. A few things are off and some files are missing because I haven't finished it, but the general idea is there.
