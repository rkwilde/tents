            How we make magic happen...

            ​

            In a Complimentary Design Consultation we can help you decide what kind of tent you are wanting; The standard style tents we offer are pole or frame tents - both have great features.  Then from there we would determine the right size tent for your needs.  Most events of 80-100 people would be well suited with a 20X40' tent (pole or frame), and 100-150 crowd works well with a 30X40'.  We also rent tents in various sizes, so give us a call to see what we have that could fit your needs.  Also, when you rent your tent there is the question of if you will want a dance floor, (we have that too), if you would like side walls,  and if you would benefit from a heater for those chillier months.  Lastly,  there are tables and chairs to consider. 

            ​

            Next, the fun design element comes into play.  Or if you aren't needing a tent, we start here!  We have high quality fabric for drapery - and plenty of it.  You can go with an elegant and classic design such as a star pattern cascading elegantly from the center of the room or you can have us drape the entire ceiling and room, with fabric cascading all around to create a truly luxurious canopy of fabric.  Or, you can decide on anything in-between -- drapery has endless possibilities and it's all up to you!  Also, we promise we won't be pushy, it's not our style, because at the end of the day we want you to be over the moon with what we are creating for you.  

            ​

            The last step is adding in what lighting you would like to compliment your design.  (And of course we can do just the lighting design as well, sometimes less is more, or your event doesn't really call for a tent or drapery - we get it).  The three most common strings of lights that are used in most designs are bistro lights, mini lights and icicle lights.  We can study those pictures you've been eyeing on Instagram, or we can suggest to you what works best from our experience.  And then, last but not least we have chandeliers for rent as well.  One, two or three, again - it's all up to you, get creative with us and make your special event truly unique!
